          &nbsp; &nbsp; VideoCrafter is a video creation toolbox consisting of:
            <ul>
                <li> A text-to-video (T2V) diffusion model : LVDM  
                <li> A finetuning mechanism to train the LVDM on specific datasets and reduce training parameters : VideoLoRA 
                <li> A conditional adapter based on T2I-adpater to increase the controls on video generation
            </ul>
          VideoCrafter has the interesting feature of allowing long-form video generation. The mechanisms used to achieve this are interesting, as typically

          &nbsp; &nbsp; There are a couple of ways you can play around with VideoCrafter. You can run it locally, run a demo on HuggingFace or the Google Colabatory notebook.

          Prompt engineering : prompt engineering is the most important parameter when it comes to generative models. Wriitng a descriptive prompt which covers most or all different elements of the desired output. A good resource to understand further is <a href="https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-to-come-up-with-good-prompts-for-ai-image-generation/" >here </a>. 

          The HuggingFace demo of VideoCrafter shows us the features we have available to play around with. <br> <img src= "videos/VideoCrafter/Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 10.17.54.png">

              <li>
                Sampling steps : the number of sampling steps used adjusts how much the diffusion model denoises the data (which in a diffusion model is 100% random noise) per step. At every step the model is predicting what the image is supposed to look like. Adding more steps implies that execution will take longer but at every step the model is making a probabilistic assumption based on a less noisy image.

              <li> CFG scale : Stands for Coefficient of Fluctuation Growth. Adjusting this scale adjusts how faithful the generated output is to the prompt. It quantifies the rate of change of the variance of a diffusion process.

              <li> eta (Î·) : weight of noise for added noise in diffusion step. This is a parameter used in the reverse process of the diffusion model. </li>
              <li> LoRA scale : LoRA is a finetuning framework that can be used to train the base diffusion model on more specialised datasets to generate results with different features.  </li>

          &nbsp; &nbsp; Diffusion models are among the more mathematically involved generative models. For more explanation on the math behind these models, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NKoy3RDuaZDxErRxup23iSF2cxetZocSf_t-n1R1Hn8/edit?usp=sharing">this doc.</a>
          Latent diffusion models are a type of machine learning model that map the characteristics of a dataset to a lower-dimensional latent space through an encoder. 
          A key intuition when considering how machine learning models is : it is desired that every arbitrary data sample can be represented by a well-understood distribution so that established properties can be used to make computations more efficient. 
          
          Diffusion models "generate" by "diffusing" an existing image of a certain class into complete noise, and then un-diffusing it into a sensible sample. This ends up generating a new image as the calculations are approximate and we make smart assumptions to preserve the structure of the image while making calculations more efficient. 
          
      In an attempt to make this math of all this less hand-wavey, let's take a bird-eye's view of the mathematics. We fix a variance
